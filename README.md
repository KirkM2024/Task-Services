Q: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
A: Before starting get a grasp as to what you are trying to achieve before starting.
When building code follow standard OOP procedures, make proper use of encapsulation and data protection.
Limit the size and scope of functions there is usually a way to write what you need in a succinct way.
Make use of proper testing cases to ensure you get the general overview of what erros to look for while testing.

Q: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
A: Make sure you you take proper notes and clearly communicate with the user as to what their excectations and desires are when requesting a program.
Do not be afraid to go back and clarify statements or ask more questions if something stops being clear.

Q:How do I approach designing software?
A: Once i have a basic understanding of what the user needs i start by being a rough skeleton of the class.
This skeleton is the essential basic needs the program needs in order to function.
I try to get the simple code out of the way first. This includes variables, simple methods and general data structures and imports.
From there i try to build the required methods and functions in accordance to user needs and OOP principles.
once i built the program and i cam sure that i have the base cases and overall code mostly correct, i can work on the Junit testing classes and work from there until completion.
